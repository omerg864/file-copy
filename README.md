# File copy from currpted hrad drive

This program copies specified types of files from one directory to another.


Problem: A friend came for me to help him extract his photos,videos and docs from a curropted hard drive the problem was the drive was disconnecting every 2 minutes. 
My solution: I wrote a program to extract the files from a directory to another and to overcome the issue of the disconnection I added a set to add directories that already been passed. I needed to add the new set manually and to run this program multiple times every time I reconnected the hrad drive.
